Install the war file into tomcat and edit the context.xml.
The parameters in the context.xml file are as follows:
"basexRestUrl" points to the relevant BaseX server REST interface eg "http://localhost:8984/rest/"
"basexUser" a read only user that will be used to perform searches
"basexPass" the password of the read only user

It is recommended to use the zip file version of BaseX and edit the ./bin/basexhttp start script to allocate adequate ram to hold the indexes in memory:
    # Options for virtual machine
    VM=-Xmx######m

The read only guest user can be created by starting the command line client: ./basexclient
create user yamsguest
grant read to yamsguest
For more details see: http://docs.basex.org/wiki/User_Management

The database can then be started with: ./bin/basexhttp

Once a crawl has been completed the resulting database can be moved into the data directory of the running BaseX server.

If however you prefer to use the BaseX war file in tomcat then you will need to configure the database in the web.xml
An example is to be found here: https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex-api/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
For more information see: http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Web_Application#Servlet_Container
Because this application does not need write access to the database it may be adequate to have only one limited user defined in the web.xml
You can also change the db admin password and add additional users in the .basexperm configuration file in the server root.

In addition it may be convenient to interrogate the database via Curl:

To list the users and permissions databases on the localhost rest interface:
curl -u user:pass -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d "<command xmlns='http://basex.org/rest'><text>show users</text></command>" "http://localhost:8984/rest/"

To list the databases on the localhost rest interface:
curl -u user:pass -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d "<command xmlns='http://basex.org/rest'><text>list</text></command>" "http://localhost:8984/rest/"


todo: add files to set the DB user permissions
