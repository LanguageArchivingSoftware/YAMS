Install the war file into tomcat and edit the context.xml.
The parameters in the context.xml file are as follows:
"basexRestUrl" points to the relevant BaseX server REST interface eg "http://localhost:8984/rest/"
"basexUser" a read only user that will be used to perform searches
"basexPass" the password of the read only user

It is recommended to use the zip file version of BaseX and edit the ./bin/basexhttp start script to allocate adequate ram to hold the indexes in memory:
    # Options for virtual machine
    VM=-Xmx######m

The read only guest user can be created by starting the command line client: ./basexclient
create user yaasguest
grant read to yaasguest

The database can then be started with: ./bin/basexhttp

Once a crawl has been completed the resulting database can be moved into the data directory of the running BaseX server.
